# Copilot Carbon Tracker

Track the environmental impact of your GitHub Copilot usage.

## How It Works

The extension estimates carbon emissions based on:
- Tokens generated by Copilot (~4 characters = 1 token)
- Energy consumption of AI models (~0.0004 kWh per 1000 tokens)
- Carbon intensity of data centers (~0.429 kg CO2e per kWh)

## Usage

1. Install the extension, or when opening this project you can actually press F5 and new separate window with extension enabled will appear.
2. Code with Copilot as usual
3. Check the status bar for your carbon count: `ðŸŒ± X.Xg CO2`
4. Click it for detailed statistics
